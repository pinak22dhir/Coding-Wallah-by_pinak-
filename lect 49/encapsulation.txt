Encapsulation
1.binding of methods and variables together into single unit 
2. also leads to data abstraction(hiding class)
3. abstraction 
enables us to display essential information while hiding implementation details
4. inheritance properties of another
singe->multiple->multilevel->hierarchical->hybrid-->diamond
5. polymorphism --> ability of objects/methods to take different forms
compile--> function 
operator 
runtime--> function overriding 
6. friend function --< non member function which can access private member of class
7. public private-->accessible only in own class protected parent +derived class
